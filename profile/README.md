## What is Borderless Gaming?

**Borderless Gaming** is an essential and widely-adopted utility software designed to transform your standard gaming experience. It effortlessly converts traditional fullscreen or standard windowed games into a sophisticated **borderless windowed mode**. This mode is a game-changer for modern PC users, as it eliminates the common frustrations associated with traditional fullscreen gaming, such as significant delays, screen flickering, and application crashes when attempting to switch between your game and other desktop applications. By operating in a borderless state, the game window behaves like any other application window but without visible borders or title bars, giving the illusion of fullscreen while retaining the flexibility of windowed mode.

This advanced functionality allows for truly seamless alt-tab usage and efficient multitasking without the notorious performance drops or stuttering. **Borderless Gaming** ensures that your game remains stable and visually consistent, preventing unwanted minimization or loss of focus. It is an indispensable tool for streamers and content creators who need to manage broadcasting software, chat overlays, and monitoring tools simultaneously. The software boasts extensive compatibility, supporting a vast library of PC games from classics to the latest AAA titles, including popular games like **Minecraft**, **Metro Exodus**, **Cyberpunk 2077**, and **Elden Ring**. Its open-source nature, active community development, and free availability solidify its position as a trusted and reliable solution for gamers of all levels seeking a polished and professional gaming setup.
